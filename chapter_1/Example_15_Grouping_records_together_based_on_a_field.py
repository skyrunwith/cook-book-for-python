Problem
    You have a sequence of dictionaries or instances and you want to iterate over the data
    in groups based on the value of a particular field, such as date.
Solution
    itertools.groupby()
Discussion
    The groupby() function works by scanning a sequence and finding sequential "runs"
    of identical values(or values returned by the given key function).

    An important preliminary step is sorting the data according to the field of interest.
    Since groupby() only examines consecutive items, failing to sort first won't group the
    records as you want.

    defaultdict():
        If your goal is to simply group the data together by dates into a large data structure
        that allows random access.

# Solution
# The itertools.groupby function is particularly useful for grouping data together
# like this. to illustrate, suppose you have the following list of dictionaries.
rows = [
 {'address': '5412 N CLARK', 'date': '07/01/2012'},
 {'address': '5148 N CLARK', 'date': '07/04/2012'},
 {'address': '5800 E 58TH', 'date': '07/02/2012'},
 {'address': '2122 N CLARK', 'date': '07/03/2012'},
 {'address': '5645 N RAVENSWOOD', 'date': '07/02/2012'},
 {'address': '1060 W ADDISON', 'date': '07/02/2012'},
 {'address': '4801 N BROADWAY', 'date': '07/01/2012'},
 {'address': '1039 W GRANVILLE', 'date': '07/04/2012'},
]

# Now suppose you want to iterate over the data in chunks grouped by date. To do it, first
# sort by the desired field(in this case, date) and then use itertools.groupby()
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import groupby

# Sort by the desired field first
rows.sort(key=itemgetter('date'))

# Iterate in groups
for date, items in groupby(rows, key=itemgetter('date')):
    print(date)
    for i in items:
        print('    ', i)

# If your goal is to simply group the data together by dates into a large data structure that
# allows random access, you may have better luck using "defaultdict()" to build a multidict.
from collections import defaultdict
rows_by_date = defaultdict(list)
for row in rows:
    rows_by_date[row['date']].append(row)

# This allows the records for each date to be accessed easily like this:
for r in rows_by_date['07/01/2012']:
    print(r)

# For this latter example, it's not necessary to sort the records first. Thus, if memory
# is no concern, it may be faster to do this than to sort the records and iterate using groupby().
